# MeshBean
A budget outdoor mesh node utilizing 2" SCH40 PVC pipe.

Current mounting options include an outrigger arm for 32mm poles such as those used for tv antennas. STEP files are included for further modifications. The top cap is meant to fit very loose on the PVC pipe. Then silicone can be used to fill the gap and still allow the cap to be broken free for maintenance.
